# MIGA Token (Freedom of Information)

MIGA is the governance token of the Freedom of Information DAO, a sister project to Pars Protocol focused on anti-censorship technology, independent media, and cultural expression for the people of Iran.

## Token Specifications

| Property | Value |
|:---------|:------|
| **Name** | MIGA |
| **Symbol** | MIGA |
| **Network** | Solana (native) |
| **Standard** | SPL Token |
| **Total Supply** | 1,000,000,000 |
| **Decimals** | 9 |

## Mission

> "MIGA is not against Iran. It is for the Iranian people."

MIGA funds:
- Independent journalism
- Anti-censorship technologies
- Satellite communication access
- VPN and mesh network tools
- Cultural content (film, music, art, literature)
- Educational platforms
- Human rights documentation
- Global awareness campaigns

## What MIGA Does NOT Fund

The DAO explicitly will never fund:
- Violence
- Political parties
- Military activity
- Armed groups
- Election interference
- State overthrow

## Governance Model

### Simple Voting

MIGA uses straightforward token-based governance:

```
1 MIGA = 1 Vote
```

### Proposal Process

1. **Submit Proposal**: Anyone can submit a mission proposal
2. **Committee Review**: DAO committee reviews for legality and safety
3. **Token Holder Vote**: MIGA holders vote on approved proposals
4. **Automatic Execution**: Smart contracts release funds upon approval
5. **Transparent Reporting**: All spending documented on-chain

## Token Distribution

### Fair Launch

MIGA guarantees a fair launch:

| Allocation | Percentage | Notes |
|:-----------|:-----------|:------|
| DAO Treasury | 100% | All raised funds |
| Founders | 0% | No allocation |
| VCs | 0% | No allocation |
| Hidden wallets | 0% | Complete transparency |

### Custody

All funds are held in:
- On-chain multi-sig vault
- Transparent treasury management
- Community-governed allocations

## Relationship to Pars Protocol

MIGA and PARS are complementary but distinct:

| Aspect | PARS | MIGA |
|:-------|:-----|:-----|
| **Network** | Pars Network (EVM) | Solana |
| **Purpose** | Financial infrastructure | Freedom of information |
| **Governance** | vePARS vote-escrow | 1 token = 1 vote |
| **Treasury** | Protocol reserves | Mission funding |

### Cross-Protocol Governance

The Committee governance formula connects both tokens:

```
committee_power = min(PARS, MIGA) × √(lock_duration / max_duration)
```

This ensures:
- Both communities have voice
- Neither token can dominate
- Balanced ecosystem governance

### Bridge

MIGA can be bridged to Pars Network via Wormhole:

- Native on Solana
- Bridged ERC-20 on Pars Network
- Same governance weight on both chains

## Funding Roadmap

| Phase | Target | Focus |
|:------|:-------|:------|
| Phase I | $5M | Independent media, encrypted communications, awareness |
| Phase II | $10M | Global cultural campaigns, community hubs, satellite |
| Phase III | $50M | Regional digital freedom infrastructure |
| Phase IV | $100M | Global censorship-resistant network |
