# What is Pars Protocol?

Pars Protocol is a decentralized financial infrastructure built for the Persian diaspora, combining treasury-backed tokens with censorship-resistant governance. Operating on the Pars Network (an EVM-compatible chain), the protocol provides PARS—a fully-backed, community-governed token that serves as the foundation for diaspora coordination.

## Vision

Pars Protocol enables a programmable, community-controlled financial system that:

- **Preserves value** via diversified treasury backing and transparent reserve management
- **Maintains liquidity** through Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) across decentralized exchanges
- **Empowers governance** using vote-escrowed tokens (vePARS) resistant to coercion and censorship
- **Funds public goods** by directing treasury yield to community-prioritized initiatives
- **Operates under adversity** with mesh network access and post-quantum cryptographic security

## Why Pars?

The 8+ million Persian diaspora spans 85+ countries with no unified coordination mechanism. Traditional financial systems fail because:

- **Centralized platforms can be blocked** by nation-state firewalls
- **Fiat stablecoins are censorable** and subject to governmental control
- **Existing DAOs lack privacy** for participants in high-threat environments
- **Classical cryptography is vulnerable** to emerging quantum computing threats

Pars Protocol addresses these challenges with a purpose-built financial stack.

## Core Principles

### Treasury-Backed Value

Every PARS token is backed by treasury reserves. Unlike unbacked stablecoins, PARS maintains intrinsic value through:

- Diversified reserve assets (stablecoins, ETH, protocol-owned liquidity)
- Transparent on-chain treasury management
- Algorithmic stability mechanisms

### Decentralized Governance

The Pars Council (شورا) governs all protocol parameters through:

- **vePARS voting**: Lock PARS for governance power weighted by commitment duration
- **Ten Committees**: Specialized working groups with domain expertise
- **Coercion-resistant voting**: Anonymous participation options for at-risk voters

### Censorship Resistance

The protocol is designed to function under network partition:

- Governance portal accessible via Pars mesh network during internet blackouts
- Post-quantum signatures protect against future cryptographic threats
- No off-chain dependencies for core operations
