# Pars Charter (منشور)

The Pars Charter (منشور - _Manshur_) is the constitutional document that defines the fundamental principles, governance structure, and operational rules of Pars DAO. This document establishes the social contract between all participants in the Pars ecosystem.

## Preamble

We, the Iranian diaspora and friends of Iran, establish this Charter to:

1. **Preserve Heritage** — Protect Persian language, culture, and identity for future generations
2. **Enable Sovereignty** — Build censorship-resistant infrastructure for self-determination
3. **Fund Freedom** — Direct resources toward anti-censorship technology and independent media
4. **Ensure Transparency** — Maintain full accountability for all treasury operations
5. **Protect Privacy** — Enable participation without fear of coercion or surveillance

*"The empire fell. The people scattered. The code endures. One day, we go home."*

- Treasury and financial operations
- Governance parameters and processes
- Committee creation and dissolution

```

### Section 1.3: Transparency

All governance actions must be:
- **On-chain** — Recorded on Pars Network or bridged chains
- **Auditable** — Traceable through public transaction history
- **Documented** — Accompanied by PIP (Pars Improvement Proposal)
- **Announced** — Published to governance forums and Town Hall

---

## Article II: Token Architecture

### Section 2.1: ASHA Reserve Token (آشا)

ASHA is the reserve asset of Pars DAO, backed by treasury holdings:

| Property | Value |
|:---------|:------|
| **Name** | ASHA (آشا) |
| **Role** | Reserve currency, treasury backing |
| **Mintable** | Yes, via bonding only |
| **Backing** | Protocol treasury assets |

ASHA is the only inflationary token in the system. It can only be minted through the bonding mechanism where users deposit collateral assets.

### Section 2.2: veASHA Governance Token

veASHA is the sole governance token for Pars DAO:

| Lock Duration | veASHA Weight |
|:--------------|:--------------|
| 1 week | 0.0048x |
| 1 month | 0.02x |
| 6 months | 0.125x |
| 1 year | 0.25x |
| 2 years | 0.50x |
| 4 years | 1.00x (maximum) |

**Properties**:
- **Non-transferable** — Cannot be sold or traded
- **Linear decay** — Voting power decreases as lock approaches expiry
- **Delegatable** — Voting rights can be delegated to any address
- **Single-token** — Only ASHA can be locked for governance power

### Section 2.3: Bondable Collateral

The following tokens are accepted as bonding collateral (not governance tokens):

| Token | Role | Governance? |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| **PARS** | Pars Network gas token | No |
| **CYRUS** | Cyrus ecosystem token | No |
| **MIGA** | MIGA DAO token | No |
| **USDC/USDT** | Stablecoin collateral | No |
| **ETH/WETH** | Blue-chip collateral | No |

These assets can be bonded to receive discounted ASHA, but they do not provide governance power directly.

## Article III: Governance Structure

### Section 3.1: Council (شورا)

The Pars Council is the supreme governance body, composed of all veASHA holders.

**Powers**:
- Pass resolutions via on-chain voting
- Elect and remove Safe signers
- Allocate treasury budgets
- Modify governance parameters
- Create and dissolve Committees

**Requirements**:
- Proposals require 0.25% of veASHA supply to submit
- Quorum: 10% of circulating veASHA
- Approval: 50% simple majority (67% for treasury >$100K)

### Section 3.2: Committees (کمیته‌ها)

Ten standing Committees execute the DAO's mission:

| Committee | Symbol | Domain |
|:----------|:-------|:-------|
| Security (امنیّت) | AMN | Safety & Protection |
| Treasury (خزانه) | KHAZ | Financial Infrastructure |
| Governance (داد) | DAD | Coordination |
| Health (سلامت) | SAL | Healthcare Access |
| Culture (فرهنگ) | FARH | Heritage & Arts |
| Research (دانش) | DAN | Knowledge & Education |
| Infrastructure (سازندگی) | SAZ | Technical Systems |
| Consular (پیام) | PAY | Community Relations |
| Venture (وقف) | WAQF | Long-term Wealth |
| Impact (میزان) | MIZ | Accountability |

Each Committee has:
- **Safe** — Multi-sig treasury vault
- **Council** — Elected governing body
- **Charter** — Operating rules and mandate
- **Identity Token** — Membership and participation token

### Section 3.3: Guardian

The Emergency Multisig serves as Guardian with limited powers:

**Can**:
- Veto malicious proposals during timelock (48 hours)
- Trigger emergency freeze for 72 hours
- Pause compromised contracts

**Cannot**:
- Pass proposals unilaterally
- Access treasury funds
- Override completed votes
- Extend own authority

Guardian actions require 2-of-5 signatures and must be reported to Council.

## Article IV: Treasury Management

### Section 4.1: Fund Sources

All treasury funds are classified by source:

| Source | Description | Parent Recallable? |
|:-------|:------------|:-------------------|
| **ALLOCATED** | Budget from parent DAO | Yes |
| **BONDED** | User-purchased via bonds | No |

This preserves community sovereignty while maintaining parent oversight.

### Section 4.2: Base Allocation

10% of protocol fees flow to Committees as guaranteed funding:

| Committee | Share | Effective |
|:----------|:------|:----------|
| KHAZ (Treasury) | 25% | 2.5% |
| AMN (Security) | 10% | 1.0% |
| SAL (Health) | 10% | 1.0% |
| FARH (Culture) | 10% | 1.0% |
| DAN (Research) | 10% | 1.0% |
| SAZ (Infra) | 10% | 1.0% |
| DAD (Governance) | 5% | 0.5% |
| PAY (Consular) | 5% | 0.5% |
| WAQF (Venture) | 10% | 1.0% |
| MIZ (Impact) | 5% | 0.5% |

### Section 4.3: Gauge-Directed Allocation

90% of protocol fees flow to the Gauge Controller for veASHA-weighted distribution to:
- Liquidity gauges (DEX incentives)
- Staking gauges (ASHA staking rewards)
- Committee gauges (additional Committee funding)
- Treasury gauge (reserve building)
- Bond gauges (bond market subsidies)
