# Resolution Process (قطعنامه)

Resolutions (قطعنامه - _Qatnameh_) are the formal mechanism for proposing changes to Pars Protocol. This document describes the complete lifecycle of a resolution from draft to execution.

## Resolution Lifecycle

Every resolution follows this path:

```
Draft ──► Submitted ──► Active ──► Queued ──► Executed
  │           │           │           │
  └─► Cancelled  └─► Defeated  └─► Vetoed  └─► Expired
```

### Phase Overview

| Phase | Duration | Description |
|:------|:---------|:------------|
| **Draft** | Indefinite | Resolution prepared off-chain |
| **Submitted** | 3 days | Review period before voting |
| **Active** | 7 days | Voting period |
| **Queued** | 48 hours | Timelock before execution |
| **Executed** | - | Resolution actions applied |

## 1. Draft Phase

### Preparation

Before submission, resolution authors should:

1. **Draft the PIP** (Pars Improvement Proposal) document
2. **Discuss on forums** at forum.pars.network
3. **Gather community feedback** via Town Hall sessions
4. **Prepare on-chain actions** with proper encoding

### Code Review Requirement

All resolutions must be:

- Added to the `pars-governance` repository
- Tested in fork simulation environment
- Reviewed by at least 2 independent parties

**Resolutions without code review will be vetoed by the Guardian.**

### Minimum Requirements

| Requirement | Value |
|:------------|:------|
| Proposer veASHA | 0.25% of total supply |
| Code repository | pars-network/pars-governance |
| Forum discussion | Minimum 7 days |
| Simulation test | Required |

## 2. Submission Phase

### Submitting a Resolution

Call `propose()` on the Governor contract with:

```solidity
function propose(
    address[] memory targets,     // Contract addresses to call
    uint256[] memory values,      // ETH values for each call
    bytes[] memory calldatas,     // Encoded function calls
    string memory description     // Resolution description
) public returns (uint256 resolutionId);
```

### Review Period

After submission, a 3-day review period begins (voting delay):

- Community reviews the resolution actions
- Technical review of on-chain code
- Discussion continues on forums
- Author can still cancel

### What to Review

1. **Intent alignment**: Does the resolution match stated goals?
2. **Security**: Are the on-chain actions safe?
3. **Consensus**: Does forum discussion show community support?
4. **Completeness**: Are all necessary actions included?

## 3. Active Phase (Voting)

### Activation

Anyone can activate a resolution after the review period by calling `activate()`:

```solidity
function activate(uint256 resolutionId) public;
```

Activation must occur within 24 hours of review period ending, or the resolution expires.

### Quorum Calculation

At activation, quorum is locked based on current veASHA supply:

```solidity
// Standard quorum
quorumVotes = (veasha.totalSupply() * quorumPct) / 100_000;

// High-risk quorum (for critical modules)
highRiskQuorumVotes = (veasha.totalSupply() * highRiskQuorum) / 100_000;
```

### Casting Votes

veASHA holders vote during the 7-day voting period:

```solidity
function castVote(uint256 resolutionId, uint8 support) public;
// support: 0=Against, 1=For, 2=Abstain

function castVoteWithReason(
    uint256 resolutionId,
    uint8 support,
    string calldata reason
) public;
```

### Vote Outcome

Resolution passes if:

1. **Quorum met**: FOR votes >= quorumVotes
2. **Approval threshold**: FOR votes >= 50% of (FOR + AGAINST)

For large treasury allocations: FOR votes >= 67%

## 4. Queued Phase (Timelock)

### Queueing

Anyone can queue a successful resolution:

```solidity
function queue(uint256 resolutionId) public;
```

The proposer's veASHA balance is checked again—if below threshold, queueing fails.

### Timelock Duration

| Resolution Type | Timelock |
|:----------------|:---------|
| Standard | 48 hours |
| Large allocation (>$100K) | 7 days |
| Critical/High-risk | 30 days |

### What Happens During Timelock

- Community final review of pending actions
- Guardian can veto if malicious intent discovered
- Emergency freeze can pause execution
- Technical preparation for execution

## 5. Execution Phase

### Executing

Anyone can execute after timelock:

```solidity
function execute(uint256 resolutionId) public;
```

Requirements:
- Timelock elapsed
- Grace period not exceeded (24 hours)
- Proposer still holds threshold veASHA

### Grace Period

Execution must occur within 24 hours after timelock ends, or the resolution expires.

## Resolution Failure Modes

### Cancelled

- Author cancels before execution
- Anyone can cancel if proposer's veASHA drops below threshold

### Defeated

- Quorum not met
- Approval threshold not reached
- Resolution automatically marked defeated after voting period

### Vetoed

- Guardian vetoes during timelock
- Resolution fails permanently
- Guardian must provide public rationale

### Expired

- Not activated within activation grace period
- Not executed within execution grace period

## Resolution Parameters

| Parameter | Current Value | Description |
|:----------|:--------------|:------------|
| `proposalThreshold` | 0.25% | Min veASHA to submit |
| `quorumPct` | 10% | Min participation |
| `highRiskQuorum` | 20% | Quorum for critical changes |
| `approvalThresholdPct` | 50% | Min FOR percentage |
| `proposalMaxOperations` | 15 | Max actions per resolution |
| `votingDelay` | 3 days | Review period |
| `votingPeriod` | 7 days | Voting duration |
| `activationGracePeriod` | 24 hours | Activation window |
| `GRACE_PERIOD` | 24 hours | Execution window |
| `delay` | 48 hours | Timelock duration |
| `MIN_VEASHA_SUPPLY` | 1,000 veASHA | Emergency threshold |

## Emergency State

If veASHA supply collapses below `MIN_VEASHA_SUPPLY`:

1. Governor enters emergency state
2. No standard resolutions can proceed
3. Only Guardian can call `emergencyPropose()`
4. Emergency resolutions address the crisis

## Resolution Types

### Standard Resolution

- Any governance change
- Parameter adjustments
- Treasury allocations &lt;$100K

### Extended Review Resolution

- Treasury allocations $10K-$100K
- 14-day voting period
- 7-day timelock

### Major Allocation Resolution

- Treasury allocations &gt;$100K
- 21-day voting period
- 67% super-majority required
- 30-day timelock

### Emergency Resolution

- Only during emergency state
- Guardian-initiated
- Expedited timelock (24 hours)

## Best Practices

### For Authors

1. **Build consensus first** via forum discussion
2. **Simulate thoroughly** in fork environment
3. **Get code reviewed** by independent parties
4. **Write clear descriptions** with rationale
5. **Respond to questions** during review period

### For Voters

1. **Read the full resolution** and linked PIPs
2. **Review the simulation results** in governance repo
3. **Participate in Town Hall discussions**
4. **Vote based on long-term protocol health**
5. **Consider delegating** if you cannot actively review
