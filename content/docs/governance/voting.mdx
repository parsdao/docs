# veASHA Voting System

The Pars Protocol governance system uses vote-escrowed tokens (veASHA) to ensure that voting power reflects long-term commitment to the protocol. This page details the mechanics of voting, delegation, and coercion resistance.

## Voting Power

### veASHA Calculation

Voting power is determined by the amount of ASHA locked and the lock duration:

```
veASHA = ASHA_amount × (remaining_lock_time / max_lock_time)
```

| Lock Duration | Initial Weight | Notes |
|:--------------|:---------------|:------|
| 1 week | 0.0048x | Minimum lock period |
| 1 month | 0.021x | |
| 6 months | 0.125x | |
| 1 year | 0.25x | |
| 2 years | 0.50x | |
| 4 years | 1.00x | Maximum weight |

Voting power decays linearly as the lock approaches expiry. A 4-year lock of 1,000 ASHA starts at 1,000 veASHA and decreases to 0 at expiry.

### Lock Management

```solidity
interface IVeASHA {
    /// @notice Lock ASHA tokens to receive veASHA
    function lock(uint256 amount, uint256 duration) external returns (uint256 lockId);

    /// @notice Extend an existing lock duration
    function extendLock(uint256 lockId, uint256 newDuration) external;

    /// @notice Add more ASHA to an existing lock
    function increaseLock(uint256 lockId, uint256 additionalAmount) external;

    /// @notice Withdraw ASHA after lock expires
    function withdraw(uint256 lockId) external;

    /// @notice Get current voting power
    function votingPower(address account) external view returns (uint256);
}
```

## Delegation

veASHA holders can delegate their voting power to any address:

### Delegation Rules

- Delegate to only one address at a time
- Entire balance is delegated (no partial delegation)
- Self-delegation is supported and common
- Changes to delegator's balance automatically adjust delegatee's power
- Delegation persists until explicitly changed

### Delegation Methods

1. **Direct Delegation**: Call `delegate(address delegatee)` on the veASHA contract
2. **Signature Delegation**: Off-chain signature via `delegateBySig()` for gasless delegation

### Delegation UI

Manage delegations at [pars.vote/delegate](https://pars.vote/delegate):

- View current delegation status
- Delegate to any address
- Self-delegate for direct voting
- View delegation history

## Pessimistic Vote Casting

The voting system uses pessimistic vote casting to prevent manipulation:

```solidity
function castVoteInternal(
    address voter,
    uint256 resolutionId,
    uint8 support
) internal returns (uint256) {
    // Get votes at resolution start and current time
    uint256 originalVotes = veasha.getPriorVotes(voter, resolution.startBlock);
    uint256 currentVotes = veasha.getPriorVotes(voter, block.number);

    // Use minimum of the two
    uint256 votes = currentVotes > originalVotes ? originalVotes : currentVotes;

    return votes;
}
```

### Examples

| Voter | At Resolution Start | When Voting | Counted Votes |
|:------|:-------------------|:------------|:--------------|
| Alice | 0 veASHA | 100 veASHA | 0 veASHA |
| Bob | 100 veASHA | 0 veASHA | 0 veASHA |
| Carol | 100 veASHA | 100 veASHA | 100 veASHA |
| Dan | 50 veASHA | 100 veASHA | 50 veASHA |

This prevents voters from buying influence after a resolution is submitted.

## Vote Options

Three vote options are available:

| Option | Value | Description |
|:-------|:------|:------------|
| Against | 0 | Vote against the resolution |
| For | 1 | Vote for the resolution |
| Abstain | 2 | Abstain (counts toward quorum) |

## Resolution Approval

A resolution passes if it meets both requirements:

### 1. Quorum

Minimum number of FOR votes required:

```
quorumVotes = (veASHA_totalSupply × quorumPct) / 100_000
```

Current quorum: **10% of circulating veASHA**

### 2. Approval Threshold

Minimum percentage of votes that must be FOR:

```
approval = (forVotes × 100_000) / (forVotes + againstVotes)
```

Current threshold: **50%** (simple majority)

For large treasury allocations (>$100K), super-majority is required: **67%**

## Coercion-Resistant Voting

For voters in high-threat environments, anonymous voting mode protects against coercion.

### Anonymous Voting Flow

### Privacy Guarantees

| Feature | Protection |
|:--------|:-----------|
| **ZK Eligibility** | Proves veASHA holdings without revealing address |
| **Nullifier** | Prevents double-voting without linking votes |
| **Deniability** | Voter can produce fake receipt showing any direction |
| **Unlinkability** | No connection between address and vote |

### When to Use Anonymous Voting

- Living in or connected to high-threat jurisdictions
- Concerns about vote coercion or surveillance
- Desire to keep voting preferences private
- Whistleblower protection scenarios

## Voting Eligibility Table

| veASHA Type | Standard Voting | Anonymous Voting |
|:------------|:----------------|:-----------------|
| veASHA in wallet | Direct | Via ZK proof |
| veASHA in Advance collateral | Requires delegation | Via ZK proof |
| veASHA on Pars L2 | Direct | Via ZK proof |
| veASHA on other chains | Snapshot only | Not available |

## Post-Quantum Signatures

All votes support ML-DSA (FIPS 204) post-quantum signatures:

```solidity
interface IPQVoting {
    /// @notice Cast vote using ML-DSA signature
    function castVotePQ(
        uint256 resolutionId,
        uint8 support,
        bytes memory pqPublicKey,
        bytes memory pqSignature
    ) external;
}
```

This uses the ML-DSA precompile at `0x0601` on Pars Network.

## Voting Best Practices

### For Individual Voters

1. **Lock for longer periods** to maximize voting power
2. **Self-delegate** to ensure your votes count
3. **Review resolutions** during the 3-day delay before voting starts
4. **Vote early** in the 7-day voting period
5. **Use anonymous mode** if you have privacy concerns

### For Delegates

1. **Communicate your positions** before major votes
2. **Vote consistently** with stated principles
3. **Participate in Town Halls** (PIP-7001) for discussion
4. **Respond to delegator questions** promptly
